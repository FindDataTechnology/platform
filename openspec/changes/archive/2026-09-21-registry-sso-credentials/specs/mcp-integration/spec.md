# mcp-integration Specification (delta)

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Server connects to MCP servers defined in mcp.json at startup

The server SHALL read `mcp.json` from the project root at startup and pass the MCP server configurations (stdio `command`/`args`/`env` and HTTP/SSE `url`/`headers`) to the dsh runtime's `dsh-mcp-client` plugin via the dsh profile, rather than connecting via the host-side `mcp-bridge.js`. The server SHALL also load MCP server configurations from the SQLite database (if present) and merge them with `mcp.json` entries, with database configs taking precedence for servers with the same name, before passing the merged set to the profile. An authenticated user's personal MCP binding SHALL be an enabled/disabled overlay over this global merged set; it SHALL NOT change the source configurations or persist a per-user copy. Role gating composes with this overlay: an installed server whose record carries a non-empty `requiredGroups` SHALL be omitted from the effective profile unless the current user's groups intersect it, so a role revoked in the identity provider takes effect on the next profile application without uninstalling the server. Credential resolution composes with both: for registry-origin servers the `Authorization` header SHALL be resolved from the current user's stored registry credential at each profile application (see the `registry-credentials` capability), and a registry-origin server whose owner lacks a live credential SHALL be omitted from the effective profile with a warning instead of being passed with a placeholder header. When no authenticated identity exists (auth off), role gating SHALL NOT filter anything. Locked bundled servers without `requiredGroups` are unaffected.

#### Scenario: stdio MCP server connects
- **WHEN** `mcp.json` declares a server with `command: "npx"` and `args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]`
- **THEN** the dsh-mcp-client plugin SHALL spawn the process, connect via stdio transport, and complete the MCP handshake within the connection timeout

#### Scenario: HTTP/SSE MCP server connects
- **WHEN** `mcp.json` declares a server with `url` and `headers`
- **THEN** the dsh-mcp-client plugin SHALL connect via HTTP transport and complete the MCP handshake within the connection timeout

#### Scenario: registry-origin server receives injected credential
- **WHEN** the effective profile is generated for a user who installed a registry-origin server and holds a live registry credential
- **THEN** that server's connection configuration carries `Authorization: Bearer <stored credential>` resolved at profile-application time
- **AND** the stored installed record contains no embedded secret

#### Scenario: registry-origin server omitted without credential
- **WHEN** the effective profile is generated for a user whose registry credential is missing or stale
- **THEN** registry-origin servers are omitted from the effective profile and a warning is logged
- **AND** the installed records are unchanged, so the servers return once a credential is stored again

#### Scenario: no mcp.json present
- **WHEN** the project root has no `mcp.json`
- **THEN** the server SHALL start normally with zero MCP servers passed to the profile and log that MCP is disabled

#### Scenario: database MCP servers are loaded
- **WHEN** the SQLite database contains MCP server configurations
- **THEN** the server SHALL load those configurations and pass them to the dsh-mcp-client plugin alongside `mcp.json` entries
- **AND** database configurations SHALL override `mcp.json` entries with the same server name

#### Scenario: personal MCP overlay is applied
- **WHEN** an authenticated user's personal binding disables a globally configured non-locked MCP server
- **THEN** that server is omitted from the user's effective runtime profile
- **AND** its global configuration remains stored and available to other users

#### Scenario: role-restricted server is omitted for non-members
- **WHEN** an installed MCP server carries `requiredGroups: ["mcp-jira-users"]` and the current user's groups do not include it
- **THEN** that server is omitted from the user's effective runtime profile and its tools are unavailable to the agent
- **AND** the stored configuration is unchanged, so the server returns when the role is granted again

#### Scenario: role revocation takes effect on next profile application
- **WHEN** a user's role is revoked in the identity provider while their cell or session holds an installed server gated on that role
- **THEN** the next effective-profile generation SHALL omit that server
- **AND** no uninstall or record mutation SHALL be required

#### Scenario: no identity means no role filtering
- **WHEN** authentication is off and an installed server carries `requiredGroups`
- **THEN** the server SHALL be included in the effective profile, because the requester is the machine owner
